# My Journey with Cloud Migrations: Lessons from 16+ Years

Over the past 16+ years, I've been privileged to work on cloud migration projects across the US, Europe, and the Middle East. From my early days at Thomson Reuters to leading complex transformations at Deloitte, I've learned that successful cloud migrations are as much about people and processes as they are about technology.

## The Early Days: Learning the Hard Way

When I started at EF Education First in 2013, cloud migration was still relatively new. We were tasked with moving services from our hosted datacenter to AWS. The experience taught me that minimal disruption isn't just a goal—it's a necessity. Every minute of downtime translates to real business impact.

## Key Lessons I've Learned

**Assessment is Everything:** Before touching any workload, spend time understanding application dependencies, data flows, and business requirements. I've seen migrations fail because teams rushed this phase.

**Start Small, Learn Fast:** Begin with non-critical workloads. Use them as learning opportunities to refine your processes before tackling mission-critical systems.

**Security Cannot Be an Afterthought:** With my CISSP certification and cybersecurity focus, I've always emphasized building security into the migration strategy from day one—not bolting it on later.

## The Multi-Cloud Reality

Today's enterprises don't just use one cloud. Having worked with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, I've learned that being platform-agnostic is crucial. Each cloud has its strengths, and the best solution often involves multiple providers.

## What I'm Thinking About Now

As I lead cybersecurity initiatives today, I see cloud security evolving rapidly. The intersection of cloud migration, containerization (Kubernetes), and security is where the real innovation is happening. Infrastructure as Code isn't just about automation—it's about making security repeatable and auditable.

If you're starting your cloud journey, my advice: invest in understanding the fundamentals, don't skip the planning phase, and remember that migration is a journey, not a destination.
